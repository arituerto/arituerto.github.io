**Abstract:**
The SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) problem is one of the essential challenges for the current robotics. Our main objective in this work is to develop a real-time visual SLAM system using monocular omnidirectional vision. Our approach is based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). We use the Spherical Camera Model to obtain geometric information from the images. This model is integrated in the EKF-based SLAM through the linearization of the direct and the inverse projections. We introduce a new computation of the descriptor patch for catadioptric omnidirectional cameras which aims to reach rotation and scale invariance. We perform experiments with omnidirectional images comparing this new approach with the conventional one. The experimentation confirms that our approach works better with omnidirectional cameras since features last longer and constructed maps are bigger.

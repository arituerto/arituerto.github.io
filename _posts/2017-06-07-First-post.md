It looks like finally got to work on creating a personal website.

Some interesting sources of information that I used for this task:

1. [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

2. [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

3. [MathJax with Jekyll](http://gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/opinion/2014/02/16/Mathjax-with-jekyll/)

4. [MathJax Documentation](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/index.html)

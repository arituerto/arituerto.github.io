## THE >X< IS NO LONGER IN PRODUCTION
### THE INFORMATION ON THIS PAGE IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE

The Cotic >X< is our beautiful cyclocross frameset. Zingy, responsive and durable in the way that only the best steel frames are, and all allied to the Cotic cornerstones of involving handling, huge tyre clearance and minimised weight. Combine this with forward thinking disc brake option, and super practical mudguard mounting eyes and you have your perfect winter partner-in-grime.

## What’s new
* Note, now only available in SUPER GLOSS BLACK. No longer available in Orange or Green.
* New frames include rear rack mounts.
* The Cotic FX custom butted heat-treated cromoly tubeset has been designed specifically for the >X<, including an Ovalform top tube for handling accuracy, compliance and comfortable shoudlering. Signature Cotic skinny wishbone seatstays read across from the ROADRAT, but in a lighter gauge with tonnes of tyre clearance, and our dinky cowled superlight cowled dropouts with replaceable mech hanger come across from the Soul. Removable rim brake mounts give a clean look if you use the disc mounts fitted to frame and fork.
* With the latest version of the frame our new lighter tapered steel forks come as standard. They come colour coded to the frame, and are available either with both disc and removable rim brake bosses, or in a true disc only version for a clean look when using disc brakes.
* Also new, are our full carbon fork upgrades. These are not colour coded. Available either with both disc and removable rim brake bosses, or in a true disc only version.

## Specifications
* Cotic designed Heat Treated Cromoly tubeset high strength, low weight.
* Large diameter thinwall tubing with Ovalform top tube give responsive and supple ride.
* Signature Cotic wishbone stay rear end. Bridge-less S-bend chainstays with Cotic Hexten gussets for improved fatigue life and massive mud clearance.
* Superlight CNC machined and pocketed dropouts with replaceable mech hanger.
* NEW: the new version of the frame includes rear rack mounts
* Confident geometry and handling with semi-compact frame layout.
* Ovalform top tube with no cable stops for comfortable shoudlering. Smaller diameter tubes compared to carbon or aluminium frames give very open front triangle for getting the bike on your back.
* Twin down tube bottle mounts for those longer riders. A 500ml bottle fits next to the head tube with a 750mm bottle behind it. Or run just a 500ml at the top and still have plenty of space for shoudlering the bike.
* Designed with plenty of clearance for tyres up to 42c.

## Sizing
* The chart is a guide to frame size. Frames are a sloping top tube design, with actual seat tube lengths 4cm shorter than the frame size 'names', i.e the 58 frame has a 54cm seat tube. The frame names are given as a guide to your size based on a regular road frame, so if you normally ride a 58cm road frame, then a 58 >X< is a good start for our bike.
* Reach and stack increase consistently between sizes, so there are no big, uneven jumps in size, so we'll be able to get you comfortable, no problem.
